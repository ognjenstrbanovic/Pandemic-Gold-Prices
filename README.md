Hello! Since I forked the original repository from our group's Tech Lead, Sean W., I wanted to use this forked repo as a description of what I did as part of the "G.S. Analytics" group.  
### Front-End
My biggest contribution was the following page:  

![Spanish Flu Page Part 1](https://github.com/ognjenstrbanovic/pandemicgoldprices/blob/master/Ognjen%20Strbanovic/Spanish%20Flu%20Page%201:2.jpg?raw=true)
![Spanish Flu Page Part 2](https://github.com/ognjenstrbanovic/pandemicgoldprices/blob/master/Ognjen%20Strbanovic/Spanish%20Flu%20Page%202:2.jpg?raw=true)  

As you may see, this includes analysis and visualization through the use of the web development trio of tools that we all know well: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You may find my Spanish Flu HTML file with this link: https://github.com/ognjenstrbanovic/pandemicgoldprices/blob/master/Ognjen%20Strbanovic/spanish_flu.html. And you may find my short JS file with this link: https://github.com/ognjenstrbanovic/pandemicgoldprices/blob/master/Ognjen%20Strbanovic/renderPlotlyOS.js.  
### Back-End
I also created my own route in the app.py file so that when I run the Flask server or local host, the data and site render.  Here is a code snippet:

### Other
I created the hypothesis for our group as well; it ended up that we could not reject the 'null hypothesis'...  

*Null Hypothesis: The statistical correlation between the rise of a global pandemic and an increase in gold prices is less than or equal to zero.  
Alternative Hypothesis: The statistical correlation between the rise of a global pandemic and an increase in gold prices is greater than zero.*  

I also facilitated the analysis of others with a short list of confounding variables for each pandemic. But more importantly, I was a constant facilitator of communication with the group in our Slack channel; and several times, I helped fellow group members with their work over Zoom sessions, particularly with the front-end stack and version control (Git).  

Lastly, I had the most commits on the team behind Sean, our designated Tech Lead. I became very comfortable with Git branches after this project.  

Thank you for your time in reading this, that is all! Until next time... ðŸ™‚
