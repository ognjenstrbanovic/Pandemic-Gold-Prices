# pandemicgoldprices
## ***Welcome to Ognjen's Project 2 README!***  
The question that we wanted to answer in a statistical manner was: "*How will the COVID-19 pandemic impact the Dow Jones Industrial Average price to gold price ratio?*"  
The way that we wanted to go about this was to study the five largest, most recent pandemics; those were:
- 1918–1920: Spanish Flu (H1N1)  
- 1957–1958: Asian Flu (H2N2)  
- 1968–1969: Hong Kong Flu  
- 2009–2010: Swine Flu (H1N1)  
- 2019-Present: COVID-19
