# pandemicgoldprices
## ***Welcome to Ognjen's G.S. Analytics Group Project 2 README!***  
The question that we wanted to answer in a statistical manner was: "*How will the COVID-19 pandemic impact the Dow Jones Industrial Average price to gold price ratio?*"  
The way that we wanted to go about this was to study the four largest preceding pandemics. We split up the analysis and visualizations as follows:
- 1918–1920: Spanish Flu (H1N1) - Ognjen S.  
- 1957–1958: Asian Flu (H2N2) - Tyler N.  
- 1968–1969: Hong Kong Flu - Luis R.  
- 2009–2010: Swine Flu (H1N1) - Todd M.  
- 2019-Present: COVID-19 - Sean W.  
The two other group members not mentioned but were played a big part in our project are Amisha P. - our project manager, who also worked on the dashboard page - and Augustine R. - our web developer, who created the home page.
