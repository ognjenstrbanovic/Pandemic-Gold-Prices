# *Welcome to Ognjen's Project 2 README!*
Hello! Since I forked the original repository from our group's Tech Lead, Sean W., I wanted to use this forked repo as a description of what I did as part of the "G.S. Analytics" group.  
My main contribution was the following page:  

![Spanish Flu Page Part 1](https://github.com/ognjenstrbanovic/pandemicgoldprices/blob/master/Ognjen%20Strbanovic/Spanish%20Flu%20Page%201:2.jpg?raw=true)
![Spanish Flu Page Part 2](https://github.com/ognjenstrbanovic/pandemicgoldprices/blob/master/Ognjen%20Strbanovic/Spanish%20Flu%20Page%202:2.jpg?raw=true)  

As you may see, this includes analysis and visualization through the use of the web development tools that we know well.
