Title,1918 Pandemic Influenza Historic Timeline,,,,,,,,,,
Intro,"In 1918, a new influenza virus emerged. During this same time period World War I was taking place. The conditions of World War I (overcrowding and global troop movement) helped the 1918 flu spread.

Below is a historical timeline of major events that took place during this time period.",,,,,,,,,,
